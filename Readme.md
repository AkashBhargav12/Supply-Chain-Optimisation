## Project Overview

### Background
This project focuses on optimizing the logistics and supply chain for a vehicle manufacturer to enhance delivery performance, improve supplier relationships, reduce transportation costs, and refine inventory management.

### User Story
As the Head of Operations, we need to optimize our inbound logistics to:
- Ensure timely delivery of parts and components
- Reduce transportation costs
- Maintain optimal inventory levels at warehouses
- Support Just in Time (JIT) manufacturing
- Enhance overall operational efficiency

### Target Audience
- Operations Director
- Supply Chain Managers
- Logistics Coordinators
- Procurement Officers

### Data Source
The analysis uses a synthesized dataset based on hypothetical supply chain operations of an automotive manufacturer, incorporating various supplier and warehouse locations across Europe and the UK.

## Objectives

1. Strengthen Supplier Relationships
2. Optimize Inventory Management for High-Demand Parts
3. Reduce Lead Time
4. Improve On-Time Delivery Rate
5. Implement Cost-Effective Transport Solutions
6. Prioritize Best Suppliers for Each Part Category
7. Adopt Best Practices in Inventory Management

## Implementation Process

### 1. Design Phase
#### Dashboard Components
- Overview Section
- Supplier Performance
- Warehouse Inventory Management
- Transportation Efficiency
- Cost Analysis
- Delivery Efficiency
- Interactive Filters and Drill-Downs

#### Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| Excel | Data exploration |
| MySQL Server | Data cleaning and analysis |
| Power BI | Interactive dashboard creation |
| GitHub | Project documentation |
| Mokkup AI | Dashboard mockup design |

### 2. Development Phase
#### Data Cleaning Process
1. Convert date columns to DateTime format
2. Handle outliers in numerical data
3. Standardize text data
4. Validate data consistency
5. Check for missing values
6. Verify data ranges

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE Cleaned_Automotive_Logistics (
    SupplierID INT,
    PartID INT,
    PartDescription VARCHAR(255),
    OrderDate DATETIME,
    EstimatedDeliveryDate DATETIME,
    ActualDeliveryDate DATETIME,
    Quantity INT,
    UnitCost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    TransportMode VARCHAR(50),
    TransportCost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    WarehouseID INT,
    WarehouseLocation VARCHAR(255),
    WarehouseCapacity INT,
    CurrentInventory INT,
    SupplierName VARCHAR(255),
    SupplierLocation VARCHAR(255),
    TotalCost DECIMAL(15, 2),
    LeadTimeDays INT
);
```
